# Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio is a compilation of data science projects and notebooks which I have created for data wrangling, data analysis & visualization and exploration of machine learning algorithms.

## Data Wrangling
- [BIXI Montreal Data Wrangling](https://github.com/bmshahrier/bixi-montreal/blob/master/bixi_montreal_data_wrangling.ipynb): In order to perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and prepare Machine Learning Models to solve different business problems of BIXI Montreal, a Dataset was created combining BIXI Open Dataset from year 2014 to 2018 and Montreal historical hourly weather dataset from year 2014 to 2018. In this exercise 105 files, 35 features and 993MB data were merged together and processed a dataset with 20 features and 1008MB of size. I used Google colab, python and pandas for this data wrangling. 
## Data Analysis and Visualization
- BIXI Montreal Exploratory Data Analysis: 
## Machine Learning
### Regression *(Predict a numerical outcome)*
### Classification *(Classifying data into a given number of class labels given some characteristics)*
### Clustering *(Group items with high similarity)*
### Time Series Analysis *(Predict a numerical outcome in the future considering the historical data)*
### Recommendation System *(Predict user response to an item)*

## Kaggle Competition
